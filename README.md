# Floppy-Walrus
Socioeconomic impacts of covid 


## Setup Instructions
To run the code in this repo, you will need a Google API key, with the Places API and the Maps Javascript API Enabled.
Save you api_key into a file called `config.py` in the root directory. It should have a single line containing your API key, as follows:
```python
gkey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```
Project proposal

Project title: 
Variation in disparities of Covid-19 Mortality in California (not the working title, please edit!) 

## Team name: 
Floppy Walrus

## Team members:
Angela, Chris, E, and Shaun

Project description/outline:
	
Purpose: 
To create a tool to analyze demographic data vs. COVID-19 vaccination rates to pinpoint which groups are at most risk. (Scale: Southern California)

Timeline: March 2020
Mortality rate 

## Applications:
Help outreach programs which demographic subsets to invest more in 
Assist clinics and medical facilities with prioritizing vaccines and care to 
 
## Research question to answer:
5 to 10 Qâ€™s
Chris: Party- How does each party get influenced by their leaders/media that they consume to get vaccinated?
Gender (vaccination and possibly exposure)- E
Shaun: Race/ethnicity - How cultural enclaves, and access to healthcare affect mortalities
TBD - Angela

Places API
Maps API



Rough breakdown of tasks: 
Collect sources- open to team - On going 
Powerpoint- Chris 
Confirm which data sets to use - On going
Set up repository
How to present data (visualization methods)
Shaun - make an interactive map showing a layer of hospitals(marker layer) and a layer that can toggle through the ethnicities (heat layer)
